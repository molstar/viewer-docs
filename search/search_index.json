This is located at the bottom of the screen below the 3D Canvas. Mouse Controls All the interactions with the molecule(s) uploaded in Mol* require using mouse controls (in the 3D canvas). These controls allow the user to manipulate the view of structures via a variety of functions such as rotating, translating, zooming, and clipping the structures. When not specified, a \u201cclick\u201d refers to pressing the left mouse button or tapping a single finger on a touchscreen. If an action is available for the right mouse button, it can also be completed by using the Control button + left mouse button. The general mouse controls are listed below: Rotate : click the left mouse button and move. Alternatively, use the Shift button + left mouse button and drag to rotate the canvas. Translate : click the right mouse button and move. Alternatively, use the Control button + the left mouse button and move. On a touchscreen device, use a two-finger drag. Zoom : use the mouse wheel. On a touchpad, use a two-finger drag. On a touchscreen device, pinch two fingers. Center and zoom : use the right mouse button to click onto the part of the structure you wish to focus on.

Moving the mouse over (or hovering over) any part of the 3D structure displayed in the 3D canvas, without clicking on it, will highlight it (by coloring it in magenta) according to the Picking Level currently selected. Additionally, in the lower right corner of the 3D canvas, information about the PDB ID, model number, instance, chain ID, residue number, and chain name is listed for the highlighted part of the structure. As you interact with the structure using the mouse, Mol* contains two modes for which the behavior of a click is different. As a result, each mode enables unique operations to be performed. To switch between the two modes, use the Selection Mode icon (shaped like a cursor) that appears in the Toggle Menu. The list below summarizes Default Mode and Selection Mode. Default Mode : A click on a residue (or any object in 3D) will focus on it. The focused residue and its surroundings (residues and ligands) will be displayed in a ball & stick representation. All local non-covalent interactions will be shown. To hide the surroundings, click on the target residue again. Selection Mode : A click on a residue (or any object in 3D) will select it. What exactly will be selected depends on the value of the Picking Level . Selected parts of the structure will appear with a bright green tint in the 3D canvas and in the Sequence Panel .

There are several ways to make selections in Mol*. You first need to open Selection Mode and change the Picking Level , if needed. To make selections, you can either click on parts of the structure in the 3D canvas or Sequence Panel , or use the Set Operations Menus in the Selection Mode toolbar. What are the four buttons with overlapping circles in the Selection Mode toolbar? The four buttons are used to modify a current selection with a new selection. The Add/Union button takes the current selection and adds a new selection to it. The Subtract/Remove button takes the current selection and removes the parts of it that are in a new selection. The Intersect button takes the current selection and selects the parts of it that are in the new selection. The Set button takes the current selection and replaces it entirely with a new selection. For example, suppose all leucine residues are selected in a structure. A user then uses each button in the toolbar and clicks the \u201chelices\u201d option. For the Add/Union button, Mol* will select all leucine residues and all helices. For the Subtract/Remove button, Mol* will select all leucine residues not in helices. For the Intersect button, Mol* will select all leucine residues in helices. For the Set button and selects helices, Mol* will select all helices. How do I select by secondary structures? If you want to select only secondary structures (alpha helices and beta strands/sheets), there are options to do this in the Selection Mode toolbar. Go to Set Selection, then click Structure Property. At this point you can choose either Helix or Beta Strand/Sheet to select either. How do I invert my selection? After making a selection of the region you want to exclude from the selection, click the Set Selection button in the Selection Mode toolbar. Under this menu, choose Manipulate Selection, then choose Inverse/Complement of Selection. How do I select a specific type of amino acid throughout the structure? Within the Selection Mode toolbar, go to Set Selection, and under Amino Acid, choose the amino acid you would like to select. For example, to select all histidine residues, click on \u201cSet Selection\u201d then scroll down to Amino Acid and click on \u201cHistidine (HIS).\u201d How can I replace which sequence is shown in the Sequence Panel? There are three drop-down menus in the Sequence Panel . The leftmost menu allows you to decide which PDB structure the new sequence should be from. The centermost menu allows you to decide which entity the new sequence should be from. The rightmost menu allows you to decide which part of the entity the new sequence should be from (if the entity contains duplicate copies). How do I switch between different models and biological assemblies for display in the 3D canvas? Go to the Controls Panel and to the Structure Panel . Clicking the presets button will show various structure presets (default, unit cell, super cell). Click next to Type to choose between the various models and assemblies available. How do I color a structure by the rainbow/spectrum color scheme? To color an entire structure from N-terminus to C-terminus as a rainbow, go to Polymer under the Components Panel . Click the Options button to the right, and select Set Coloring. Under this menu, select Residue Property, which will open another menu. Select Sequence Id. This will color each of the polymer chains from N- to C-terminus from blue to red color. How do I color based on chain? To color an entire structure based on chain, go to Polymer under the Components Panel . Click the Options button to the right, and select Set Coloring. Under this menu, select Chain Property, which will open another menu. Select Chain Id. This will give each chain a different color. How do I color a structure based on hydrophobicity?

Under this menu, select Residue Property, which will open another menu. Select Secondary Structure. Alpha helices will be colored pink, beta strands/sheets will be colored light orange, and all other residues will be colored while. How do I color a domain? To color a domain, use Selection Mode to select the domain using either the Sequence Panel or by clicking on the residues in the domain in the 3D canvas. Click the Apply Theme to Selection button and select a color. When done, click Apply Theme. How do I change the transparency of representations and surfaces? To change the transparency, select the whole structure or part of the structure using Selection Mode . Click the Apply Theme to Selection button and change the Action to Transparency. Use the Value slider to change the transparency and click Apply Theme to finish. How do I hide certain parts of a structure? If a component of that region does not already exist, make a selection of the region you wish to hide, and create a component out of it. Go to the Components Panel and click the eye icon next to the component of choice to hide it. The component can be shown again by clicking the eye icon again. How do I change the representation of my structure? Depending on which part of the structure you want to change representation for, choose one of the components under the Components Panel . If you want to change the representation for a selection and a component does not exist, create a component from this selection. Select Options for the component of choice, and click Add Representation and choose the representation you desire. How do I show the surface of my structure? Go to the Components Panel and click Options for Polymer. Click Add Representation and select Gaussian Surface or Molecular Surface. How do I focus on part of a structure? There are several ways to focus on part of a structure. In default mode, click on a residue in the 3D canvas or in the Sequence Panel to focus on it along with surrounding residues. Alternatively, click on an object listed in the Components Panel to focus on it. If an object is currently selected, click on it in the Structure Panel to focus on it. How do I measure distances? Select two items that you want to measure the distance between. Go to the Measurements Panel, and select Add. Select Distance. The distance will be labeled in the 3D canvas and have a new menu under Controls. How do I measure angles? Select three items that you want to measure the angle between, making sure that the second selection is the vertex. Go to the Measurements Panel, and select Add. Select Angle. The angle will be labeled in the 3D canvas and have a new menu under Controls. How do I label my structure? Select an item that you want to label . Go to the Measurements Panel, and select Add. Select Label. The label will be displayed in the 3D canvas and have a new menu under Controls. How do I compare/superpose multiple structures? The Superposition Panel allows for multiple structures to be superposed. First, visit molstar.org/viewer and upload two or more structures. In order to superpose by chains, select two or more polymer chains/residues from multiple structures and click \u201cSuperpose\u201d to superpose them. In order to superpose by atoms, select one or more atoms from multiple structures and click \u201cSuperpose\u201d to superpose them. The level of similarity between the selections in the two structures can be assessed by examining the superposed structures visually in the 3D canvas and also by monitoring the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) displayed at the bottom of the page in the Log Panel. When would I use superposition to compare structures \u201cby chains\u201d and \u201cby atoms?\u201d There are advantages to superposing \u201cby chains\u201d and \u201cby atoms.\u201d For instance, superposing by chains is useful when seeking to align dissimilar structures. If the regions that need to be aligned are unknown, superposing by chains helps orient secondary structural elements in the 3D canvas. Another benefit of superposing by chains is aligning selected residues. This enables parts of chains (e.g., domains, active sites) to be aligned in multiple structures. In this example, the PDB IDs 6PVP and 6DVW are used. These structures represent open and closed state transient receptor proteins. It is possible to align the proteins by chain, which yields an RMSD of 3.35. When 34 residues from only one of the helices is selected from the same chain in each structure, an RMSD of 1.08 is recorded. This is a good method to reduce the RMSD. Superposing by atoms is helpful when looking at the orientations of a small molecule present in multiple structures.This is an example of where superposing structures by atoms is helpful: the antibiotic structures for actinomycin 1A7Y and 1A7Z. In this structure, the core atoms that remain the same were selected in the same order, and this superposition gives an RMSD value of 0.12. How can I improve the RMSD value for my superposition? When superposing structures, an RMSD value is given that is calculated from the superposed regions. The lower the number the better the match between the regions compared. It is up to the user which regions they want to superpose, depending on their research question. However, there are a few ways to improve the superposition and RMSD value. If you have superimposed your structures by chain, the RMSD value for that alignment may be large if some of the loops or termini of these structures are not well aligned.. In this case, it may be valuable to limit the selections to certain regions of the chains, such as secondary structures like alpha helices or beta sheets. In this example, in a superposition of the structures 1D0T and 1D0U, the whole chain is selected for both structures to align them. This gives an RMSD value of 1.62. Now, when only a portion of the sequence is selected to align the structures, an RMSD value of 1.41 is obtained. If you are superposing the structures by atoms, you can conduct a similar process. It is important to note that a lower RMSD value may not mean an overall better superposition. Again, it is up to the researcher to decide what they want to superpose. Using the example of the structures 1A7Y and 1A7Z, if only three pairs of atoms are chosen to superpose the structures, an RMSD value of 0.01 is observed, but the rest of the structure is not as well aligned. Now if we choose 6 pairs of atoms from across the molecule, then a higher RMSD value of 0.50 is obtained, but there is a neater overall alignment of the two structures. It is up to the user on how to optimize the superposition of the structures. How do I represent my ligand when it is a peptide-like molecule? Sometimes, when a structure is loaded, a portion of the structure may have multiple representations, and changing the representation doesn\u2019t fix the problem. In this case, it is helpful to empty out all the preset components and create them again with the representation you desire. In this example, we will use the structure (6LU7) for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease with an inhibitor N3. When you pull up this structure, it shows the whole structure with the inhibitor as well. The inhibitor is shown in ball-and-stick form, as the Components Panel suggests, but there is also a cartoon backbone that is not hidden by trying to make the representation of the ligand ball-and-stick. In this case, the best plan of action is to empty the preset components, and this clears the 3D canvas. Then select the chain of whichever component you will be creating. In this case, I chose the ligand, and selected the chain in the Sequence Panel. Then create a component in the Selection Mode toolbar as shown below. At this point the ligand shows in the 3D canvas as a ball-and-stick representation without the cartoon showing. At this point, a covalent bond to a cysteine on the protein from the ligand does not show. There are a few ways to fix this. You can either zoom into the structure in default mode by focusing on the residues near this bond. You can also make a component of the residues involved in the bond, and show them using a ball-and-stick representation. How do I change the color or representation of one chain in the structure? The easiest way to do this is to make a component of the chain you are trying to change. In the Components Panel, you can then select the component of the chain to change its color or representation. For example, PDB structure 6lu7 depicts the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitor N3. The biological assembly contains two identical chains (which we will call chain A ASM_1 and chain A ASM_2). When this structure is opened in Mol*, both chains are colored green and are shown in the ribbon representation. Suppose you wanted to show the molecular surface only chain A ASM_1and color it based on hydrophobicity. The first step is to select the entirety of chain A ASM_1 and create a component of it. To change the representation, open the components menu for the chain A ASM_1 component (shown in a black box with a dashed line in the image below ). Use the Add Representation menu and click on \u201cmolecular surface.\u201d The display should look like the following: Next, we change the color of chain A ASM_1 by opening up the components menu for the chain A ASM_1 component and using the Set Coloring menu and click on \u201chydrophobicity.\u201d As can be seen in the image below, the coloring and representation changes have been applied to only chain A ASM_1 and not chain A ASM_2. How do I show hydrogen bonds (non-covalent interactions)? In order to show any non-covalent interactions, the components\u2019 representations need to be adjusted. Non-covalent interactions is one of the representations available if you click Add Representation for any of the components. The non-covalent interactions that are shown can be modified using the options under the button next to Add in the Components Panel . Once Non-covalent Interactions is clicked on, a drop-down menu will show the various non-covalent interactions that can be toggled on and off for viewing. Once this is decided, non-covalent interactions can be added as a representation. For this example, non-covalent interactions for the entire polymer of 3PQR will be shown. For reference, the structure looks like this prior to adding representations to the cartoon representation of the polymer. At this point, click on Polymer, and click Add Representation. To be able to visualize the atoms that are involved in the non-covalent interactions, turn on both the Ball & Stick and Non-covalent Interactions. Now there should be three representations, and the structure should look like this. Now if you want to see what interaction is being shown, mouse over the interaction, and it will show in the bottom right corner of the 3D canvas. How do I tweak the hydrogen bond distance threshold? In order to change the parameters for hydrogen bonds, or any other non-covalent interactions, click on the Options button in the Components panel, and click on the options button for any of the interactions you want to tweak the parameters for. Once this is done, there are various options for tweaking the parameters. Clicking on the question mark for any of the options will give a short description of what that option is responsible for calculating. How to display the interactions of a ligand with amino acids and ligands bound nearby? If you want to show the interactions nearby a ligand, including the hydrogen bonding and any other kinds of bonding, you need to focus on the target first. For example, if you want to show how a ligand binds to a protein, and you want to color the surrounding residues while showing the interactions, there are a set of steps to follow in a specific order. First you need to focus on the target ligand. In this example, the structure 4HHB will be used. If you want to show the heme group and its interactions with the hemoglobin structure, first you need to focus on the heme group. Make sure you are in the default mode and click on the heme group in the 3D canvas. This will focus on the heme group and show the interactions with the residues around it. Now the interactions between the heme group and the protein are shown. If you click away from this, the structure will unfocus and go back to the starting display. You will need to focus again. To color the heme group one color and the surrounding residues a separate color, these are the steps that can be taken. In order to first color the heme group, you will need to select it. Click open the Selection Mode toolbar. Select the heme group by clicking on it in the 3D canvas. Now color it the desired color using the color tool in the Selection Mode toolbar, and clicking Apply Theme. Now to invert the selection to the surrounding 5 \u212b of residues, in the Selection Mode toolbar, go to Set Selection, then Manipulate Selection, and choose Surrounding Residues (5 \u212b) of Selection. It should look like the following. Now color this selection as before to the color of your choosing. If you deselect everything, you will see an image like the following. You can now save this image using the Screenshot / State Snapshot option in the toggle menu. If I have multiple structures uploaded, how can I toggle between the display of the structures? It can be tricky dealing with multiple structures. To make it simpler, it is important to know how to display only one structure at a time, and to be familiar with switching between which structure is displayed. After the structures are uploaded, you\u2019ll need to use the Structure Panel and Components Panel to do this. In the example below, PDB structures 6lu7 (SARS-CoV-2 main protease bound by an inhibitor) and 6yb7 (SARS-CoV-2 main protease with an unliganded active site) were uploaded at rcsb.org/3D-view. A simple superposition using chain A ASM_1 in each structure was performed to overlay the two structures. The Mol* page should look like the following image, with 6lu7 shown in green and 6yb7 shown in purple: Next, we want to hide one of the structures while showing the other structure. Suppose the structure we want to hide is 6lu7. To do this, go into the Structure Panel and locate the Structures menu. This menu lists each structure uploaded into Mol*. Clicking on one of the structures in this menu will show the components for just that structure in the Components Panel. We want to see the components for only 6lu7 so we can opt to hide them. In the Structures menu, click on \u201cNone\u201d to deselect both structures, then click on \u201c6LU7 | Assembly 1\u201d to display its components. The Structures menu should look like the following image: Then go to the Components Panel where it lists the components of only 6lu7. Click the \u201ceye\u201d icon to hide each component. In the 3D canvas, you should only see 6yb7. Next, suppose we want to show 6lu7 and hide 6yb7. First, we need to reshow the components of 6lu7. To do this, go the Structures menu in the Structure Panel and select only 6lu7. Then, use the Components Panel to show the components of 6lu7. In the 3D canvas, you should see both structures. To hide 6yb7, use the Structures menu to select only 6yb. It should look like the following image: Then go to the Components Panel where it lists the components of only 6yb7. Click the \u201ceye\u201d icon to hide each component. In the 3D canvas, you should only see 6lu7.

If the regions that need to be aligned are unknown, superposing by chains helps orient secondary structural elements in the 3D canvas. Another benefit of superposing by chains is aligning selected residues. This enables parts of chains (e.g., domains, active sites) to be aligned in multiple structures. In this example, the PDB IDs 6PVP and 6DVW are used. These structures represent open and closed state transient receptor proteins. It is possible to align the proteins by chain, which yields an RMSD of 3.35. When 34 residues from only one of the helices is selected from the same chain in each structure, an RMSD of 1.08 is recorded. This is a good method to reduce the RMSD. Superposing by atoms is helpful when looking at the orientations of a small molecule present in multiple structures.This is an example of where superposing structures by atoms is helpful: the antibiotic structures for actinomycin 1A7Y and 1A7Z. In this structure, the core atoms that remain the same were selected in the same order, and this superposition gives an RMSD value of 0.12.","title":"When would I use superposition to compare structures \u201cby chains\u201d and \u201cby atoms?\u201d"},{"location":"faqs-scenarios/#how-can-i-improve-the-rmsd-value-for-my-superposition","text":"When superposing structures, an RMSD value is given that is calculated from the superposed regions. The lower the number the better the match between the regions compared. It is up to the user which regions they want to superpose, depending on their research question. However, there are a few ways to improve the superposition and RMSD value. If you have superimposed your structures by chain, the RMSD value for that alignment may be large if some of the loops or termini of these structures are not well aligned.. In this case, it may be valuable to limit the selections to certain regions of the chains, such as secondary structures like alpha helices or beta sheets. In this example, in a superposition of the structures 1D0T and 1D0U, the whole chain is selected for both structures to align them. This gives an RMSD value of 1.62. Now, when only a portion of the sequence is selected to align the structures, an RMSD value of 1.41 is obtained. If you are superposing the structures by atoms, you can conduct a similar process. It is important to note that a lower RMSD value may not mean an overall better superposition. Again, it is up to the researcher to decide what they want to superpose. Using the example of the structures 1A7Y and 1A7Z, if only three pairs of atoms are chosen to superpose the structures, an RMSD value of 0.01 is observed, but the rest of the structure is not as well aligned. Now if we choose 6 pairs of atoms from across the molecule, then a higher RMSD value of 0.50 is obtained, but there is a neater overall alignment of the two structures. It is up to the user on how to optimize the superposition of the structures.","title":"How can I improve the RMSD value for my superposition?"},{"location":"faqs-scenarios/#how-do-i-represent-my-ligand-when-it-is-a-peptide-like-molecule","text":"Sometimes, when a structure is loaded, a portion of the structure may have multiple representations, and changing the representation doesn\u2019t fix the problem. In this case, it is helpful to empty out all the preset components and create them again with the representation you desire. In this example, we will use the structure (6LU7) for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease with an inhibitor N3. When you pull up this structure, it shows the whole structure with the inhibitor as well. The inhibitor is shown in ball-and-stick form, as the Components Panel suggests, but there is also a cartoon backbone that is not hidden by trying to make the representation of the ligand ball-and-stick. In this case, the best plan of action is to empty the preset components, and this clears the 3D canvas. Then select the chain of whichever component you will be creating. In this case, I chose the ligand, and selected the chain in the Sequence Panel. Then create a component in the Selection Mode toolbar as shown below.

The backbone atoms of the peptide in this region forms a right handed helical structure, hence the name. Angstrom - A unit of length equal to 10-10 meters. It is the approximate diameter of a hydrogen atom and is commonly used to measure atomic dimensions. Asymmetric unit - The smallest part of a crystal structure to which space group symmetry can be applied to produce the entire crystal. The asymmetric unit may contain a whole molecule, a portion of a molecule, or multiple molecules and does not necessarily represent the functional unit of the molecule under investigation. Atom - The smallest unit of a chemical element that has the characteristics of that element. An atom is composed of protons and neutrons in a nucleus that is surrounded by electrons. Beta sheet - A type of secondary structure seen in proteins that is characterized by a regular pattern of hydrogen bonds between 2 or more strands of amino acid chains lying side-by-side running either parallel to each other or antiparallel. The hydrogen bonds are formed between carbonyl groups of one chain and amino groups of the adjacent chain to form a sheet-like structure. Biological assembly - The biologically functional molecule which may be different from the crystallographic asymmetric unit (see asymmetric unit ). Cartesian coordinates - An X-Y-Z coordinate system with the axes at 90 degrees to each other. Chain - A covalently linked biopolymer composed of specific building blocks - such as a polypeptide or protein (made of amino acids) and polynucleotide or DNA and RNA (made of nucleotides). Chains in the PDB are assigned identifiers or chain IDs, such as A, B, C so that they can be easily identified. Dihedral - This is an angle defined between 2 planes and helps position the spatial relationship between four atoms (A, B, C, D) - i.e., the angle between the plane containing atoms A, B, and C and the plane containing atoms B, C, and D. Entity - A unique molecule under investigation, and can be one of three types: polymer, non-polymer and water. Entities are described only once, even in those structures that contain multiple observations of an entity. For example, in a DNA molecule containing two identical chains the entity would be one of the individual chains rather than the double helix. Fo-Fc map - (also called a difference or omit map) Electron density map showing the difference between the observed and calculated models. I shows regions that were present in the observed map but not accounted for by the model 2Fo-Fc map - Electron density map that combines the observed and omit maps (i.e., Fo + Fo-Fc). This map is commonly used for model building. Hydrophilic - Functional groups, amino acids, molecules, or domains that prefer to be in an aqueous environment are termed hydrophilic. Hydrophilic groups tend to make favorable interactions with water, usually through hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic - Functional groups, amino acids, molecules, or domains that prefer to be in a non-aqueous (lipid) environment because they cannot make favorable interactions with water. They are usually composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Inhibitor - A molecule that blocks or suppresses the biological activity of another molecule. Ligand - A molecule that binds specifically to another molecule (usually a protein or nucleic acid) to form a complex. A ligand is often a small molecule, but can also be another protein. Molecule - The smallest unit of a substance that has the characteristics of that substance. A molecule consists of one or more atoms bound together. Non-covalent interactions Hydrogen bonds - A weak bond between a hydrogen atom (that is covalently attached to one electronegative atom, such as e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) and positioned close to another electronegative atom. Hydrogen bonds are important in stabilizing many biological structures (alpha helices and beta sheets) and interactions (base pairing between complementary strands of nucleotides). Ionic bonds - A bond wherein two oppositely charged atoms (or ions) - one positive and one negative interact based on their charges. Van der Waals interactions - Weak interactions occurring between uncharged atoms due to attraction and repulsion between permanent or transient electric dipole moments. It was named after the Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals. Hydrophobic bonds - See Hydrophobic Polymer - A large molecule formed by covalently joining together small building blocks (monomers) e.g., amino acids and nucleotides. Polypeptide - A long string of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Primary structure - The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein linked by peptide bonds. Protein symmetry - Point group or helical symmetry of identical subunits Protein pseudosymmetry - symmetry of homologous, or comparable, protein subunits Global symmetry - symmetry of the entire protein complex Quaternary structure - The arrangement of multiple tertiary structure domains or subunits composed of different polymer chains interacting to form higher order spatial arrangements. Residue - A single unit composing a polymer, such as an amino acid in a protein. Representations - Molecular representation of model coordinates Ball & stick - A representation in which each atom is represented as a ball and all covalent interactions (bonds) are shown as sticks. Cartoon - The representation of backbone atoms (e.g., C-alpha atoms in proteins) shown connected by ribbons, arrows, and coils to represent secondary structures Gaussian surface - A representation of the protein\u2019s surface showing the surface of each of the atoms in the molecule Label - A way to identify the amino acid residue type and amino acid number in the model. Each amino acid is shown by a label Molecular surface - A representation in which solvent-excluded surfaces of the molecule is shown. It shows the overall shape of the molecule, surface features and any binding pockets.

These are regions where the van der Waals shells of atoms overlap, as listed in the validation report for the structure Spacefill - A representation in which each atom is represented by a sphere with a radius proportional to that of the atom type (element). This representation is useful for observing how much space a molecule fills Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic position - Measure of the average distance between corresponding atoms in superimposed structures. A smaller value indicates similarity, while a higher value indicates divergence or difference in the structures. Secondary structure - The local arrangement of a protein arising from regular patterns of hydrogen bonding interactions within the polypeptide backbone. The two main types of secondary structure are the alpha helix and the beta-pleated sheet. Side chain - The variable group in an amino acid that is attached to the central carbon Tertiary structure - The arrangement of the secondary structure elements of a protein arising from interactions of the side chains including the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues as well as non-covalent forces. Unit cell - The minimum repeat unit within a crystal which can be used to generate the entire crystal structure using only translation. The position of atoms in the unit cell are expressed in fractional coordinates in terms of a, b, and c (the axes) or as x, y, and z of cartesian coordinates. Although several different unit cells can be used for the arrangement of atoms and molecules in a crystal, the convention is to choose the unit cell with the highest symmetry.

See Selections Logic for more information about how and when to use Selection Mode. Selection Mode allows parts of 3D structures to be selected by clicking on them. It also allows residues to be selected through Set Operations Menus. Selection Mode is enabled by clicking on the cursor icon in the Toggle Menu. Activating Selection Mode opens a toolbar that appears at the top of the 3D canvas. The following provides an illustration of the toolbar and a description of each of the buttons: Function Description Icon Picking Level for Selecting and Highlighting Controls to what level a selection or highlight interaction is applied (i.e., atom, residue, chain, etc.) Add/Union Selection The new selection will be the union of the current and the other selection Remove/Subtract Selection The new selection will be the current selection with parts that are in the other selection removed Intersect Selection The new selection will be the intersection of the current selection and the other selection Set Selection The new selection will be the other selection Apply Theme to Selection Enables changes of color , transparency , and clipping to be applied to the current selection Create Component of Selection with Representation Enables components to be created and its representations to be changed independent of other components Remove/Subtract Selection from All Components Removes the current selection from being displayed in the 3D canvas Undo Modify Selection Allows certain actions (changes of color, hiding of components, etc.) to be reverted while remaining in the selection mode Show/Hide Help Offers a summary of selection operations, representation operations, and mouse controls Turn Selection Mode Off Switches from Selection Mode to Default Mode #### Picking Level The Picking Level in Mol* controls to what level a selection or highlight interaction is applied. Specifically, a selection/interaction can be extended from a single atom to a residue, chain, entity, model, or structure. The default level is residue. For the case of structures with symmetry instances, the interaction can also be extended to include all atom, residue, and chain instances of the clicked atom. In addition, the Picking Level determines the specificity of a selection in the Sequence Panel , or the specificity of the focus in Default Mode . The Picking Level menu can be changed via a menu in the Selection Mode toolbar located at the top of the 3D canvas. Making Selections Making selections in Mol* allows for many operations to be performed. Although there are several ways to make selections, the first step is to enable Selection Mode using the cursor icon in the Toggle Menu. After activating Selection Mode, the easiest way to select is to click on objects in the 3D canvas or the Sequence Panel . Changing the Picking Level makes selections more fine (e.g., selecting atoms) or more coarse (e.g., selecting whole chains). The second way to select is with the Set Operations Menus that appear when Selection Mode is active. There are four set operations, each represented by two overlapping circles. They all open the same menu with a list of possible options for selections. If nothing is selected, the selection is empty. If an object is currently selected (i.e., the current selection is not empty), that selection can be modified with another selection using the operations. In the icons, the current selection is represented by the left circle and the other selection is represented by the right circle. After the set operation, the resulting selection (and new current selection) is represented by the filled part of the circles. Add/Union: The new selection will be union of the current and the other selection. Subtract/Remove: The new selection will be the current selection with parts that are in the other selection removed. Intersect: The new selection will be the intersection of the current selection and the other selection. Set: The new selection will be the other selection. Another way to make selections is to use the Components Panel . If a component of part of a structure is already created, it can be selected via the drop-down menu in the Components Panel.

Structure Panel The Structure Panel allows the user to view the structure in different forms depending on the purpose. The options of display include the deposited coordinates or asymmetric unit (called Model) or various assemblies of the deposited coordinates. Clicking on the structure name provides a drop-down menu of the structure(s) that are present. When multiple structures are being displayed, structures can be set as active or inactive by selecting a structure using its PDB identifier. NMR structures deposited as ensembles have multiple models in the coordinate file. The Structure Panel shows a bar where the user can scroll through the various models. There are also arrows on the top left corner of the 3D canvas for scrolling through the various models. Clicking on the presets button next to the structure name provides a drop-down menu of alternate views of the structure. Default (Assembly): Creates a structure for assemblies in the file/entry. Unit Cell: Creates a structure that fills the crystallographic unit cell. Only available for X-ray entries. Super Cell: Creates a structure that fills the crystallographic unit cell and all neighbouring unit cells. Only available for X-ray entries. All Models: Creates a structure for each model in the file/entry. Only available for multi-model files/entries. Under the structure name, you can select the type of view {Model, Assembly, Symmetry Mates, Symmetry (indices), Symmetry (assembly)}. If multiple structures are uploaded at molstar.org/viewer/ , the Structure Panel will list all the structures. The Structures menu is useful for selecting a structure to have its components listed in the Components Panel. Measurements Panel The Measurements Panel allows the user to make desired measurements in a structure ( labels , distances , angles , dihedrals ) to observe relationships between units in the structure (e.g. hydrogen bond distance between atoms). To start making measurements, click on the Add button and a drop-down menu will show up. In order to take measurements, the appropriate number of selections need to be made - two selections to measure distance, three selections to measure angles, and four selections to measure dihedrals. Without the appropriate number of selections, the measurement options will not be available for use. See Selection Mode for information on making selections. The measurement will be made based on which Picking Level is used for the selections. When the selections are atoms, the measurements will be made from the center of the atoms. If another Picking Level, such as residues or chains, is used, the measurements will be made using points from the center of the space that the selection occupies. This means that if three residues are selected for an angle measurement, the angle will not be taken from the alpha carbon, but from a point from the center of the space the residue takes up. Within the Measurements Panel, the selections can be toggled up and down using arrows that show up next to them. This allows the user to make all of their selections first and then specifying which of the selections should be used for the measurements (toggling them up to the top of the selections listing). Additionally, the options button next to the Add button gives the option to change the units in which distance is measured, as well as color options for the text display on the 3D canvas. Labels : In order to label a part of the structure, one selection needs to be made. In this example, one atom from the structure 4HHB was selected. Once this is done, the Labels option is available. Click on it and a label will show up on the 3D canvas, as well as a new Labels menu under the Controls. In the Labels menu, you can choose to hide the label on the 3D canvas by clicking on the eye icon, and clicking on it again will show the label. You can delete the label by clicking on the trash icon. For more options, you can click on the rightmost icon (three dots). This will reveal a drop-down menu with Options and Advanced Options, which can be used to adjust the display of the label on the 3D canvas. Distance : In order to measure distance, two selections must be made. In this example, two atoms from the structure 4HHB were selected. Once this is done, click on the Add button under the Measurements Panel. Under this, the measurement options will be shown, as well as any selections made. The Distance option is now available. Click on it and the distance will be measured and displayed both in the 3D canvas, as well as under a new Distance menu under the controls. The icons in the Distances menu perform the same functions as those in the Labels menu. See Labels for more information. Angles : In order to make angle measurements, three selections need to be made. In this example, three atoms from the structure 4HHB were selected. The order in which the selections are made will affect the angle that is measured. The second selection will be the vertex of the angle, so make selections accordingly. Once three selections are made, the Angle option is available Click on it, and an angle measurement will show up on the 3D canvas, as well as a new Angles menu under the Controls. The icons in the Angles menu perform the same functions as those in the Labels menu. See Labels for more information. Dihedrals : In order to make a dihedral angle measurement, four selections need to be made. In this example, four atoms from the structure 4HHB were selected. The order in which the atoms are selected will affect the angle that is measured. The second and third selections represent the line along which the angle between the first and fourth selections is measured. Once the selections are made, the Dihedral option will be available. Click on the Dihedral option, and a dihedral angle measurement will show up on the 3D canvas, as well as a Dihedrals menu under Controls. The icons in the Dihedrals menu perform the same actions as those in the Labels menu. See Labels for more information.

A component can be added by making a selection and either using the Components icon in the Selection Mode toolbar or using the Add button in the Components Panel under Controls. Components that can be viewed under the panel can include the polymer, any ligands that are present in the structure, and any added components. Additionally, if a selection is made while in default mode, then the focused region will include two targets as well: [Focus] Target, [Focus] Surroundings (5 \u212b). The icons next to each component perform similar functions as seen in the Measurements Panel. When the options icon for a component is selected, various options are available. Add Representation: Can choose the representation of that component (cartoon, ball-and-stick, Gaussian, etc.) Set Coloring: Choose the coloring of the component Modify by Selection: Gives selection options given in the Selection Mode toolbar A visual representation of the unit cell is also available, and can be enabled by clicking the eye icon next to the Unit Cell option. The following are the representation options available: Ball & stick Cartoon Gaussian surface Label Molecular surface Orientation Point Putty Validation clashes To modify a selection within a component, first make a selection, and choose Modify by Selection for the component of choice within the Components Panel, and choose one of these options: Include - This will include the selection in the component Subtract - This will remove the selection from the component Intersect - This will change the component to be the intersection between the original component and the selection Additionally, the Options button next to the Add button under the components panel allows for adjustments for the representation of non-covalent interactions. Display of hydrogen atoms in the visual can be toggled on and off. Additionally, clicking Non-covalent interactions yields a drop down menu with various types of non-covalent interactions. These can be toggled on and off for display in the non-covalent interactions representation. Additionally, clicking on the options button (three dots) next to any of the interactions yields a drop down menu for various parameters for that interaction. This menu can be used to tweak the parameters for calculation for any of the interactions. Density Panel The Density Panel gives options to display the electron density maps used to determine the structure in the 3D canvas. This option is only available for structures solved by X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy. When enabled, the display of each of the maps can be adjusted using the sliding bars available. Visualization of the maps can be adjusted by clicking the + icon next to each map, which will give a drop-down menu of options. They can be shown by a wireframe, which can be turned on by clicking next to the Wireframe option. The color of each map can be changed in this map, as well as the opacity of the map. View of the maps can be adjusted by clicking on the drop-down menu next to the View button, which gives options to view the maps in different settings. In this menu, the density maps can be turned off, as well as adjusted to be shown around a focus, for the whole structure, or for a bounded box. For the bounded box, the user can select the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the box within which the density maps will be displayed. In order to view any changes made within this panel, click Update at the bottom of the panel. Assembly Symmetry Panel The Assembly Symmetry Panel demonstrates any symmetries within the molecule when displayed in Assembly mode. Once enabled, any symmetries that are in the molecule will be available as a drop-down menu to display and visualize on the 3D canvas. Additionally, the coloring of the symmetry can be adjusted. Import Panel (only available at molstar.org/viewer/ ) The Import Panel enables users to upload multiple molecular structures into Mol* to compare them or perform superpositions. The Import Panel can only be accessed at molstar.org/viewer/ and is located at the top of the Controls Panel. Open Files: The Open Files menu is used to upload structures from computer files. The menu also provides structure display options. To automatically view the structure in the 3D canvas, set Visuals to \u201cOn.\u201d After a file is selected and the desired options are chosen, click \u201cApply\u201d to upload the structure. Download Structure: The Download Structure menu is used to access or download structures directly from various archives such as the PDB, PDB-Dev, SWISS-MODEL, or PubChem by inputting IDs/accession codes. The identifiers of multiple structures can be listed at once by separating them with commas. After the identifiers have been inputted, click \u201cApply\u201d to upload the structures. Session Panel (only available at molstar.org/viewer/ ) The Session Panel enables users to save sessions and views. Sessions are downloaded as computer files which can be opened in Mol* at any time. In addition, users can share session files with others to collaborate. Within a Mol* session, users are able to create \u201cviews\u201d which contain all the information in the 3D canvas at the time the views were saved. Multiple views can be saved in a single session. The Session Panel can only be accessed at molstar.org/viewer/ and is located in the Controls Panel. Saving Views: The Views menu is used to save views in Mol*. Users can name views and write a description for each one. After clicking \u201c+ Add,\u201d the view will be saved in the Views menu for the entirety of the session. Deleting/Replacing Views: The Views menu contains a list of all saved views. Next to each view is a trash can icon. Clicking that icon allows the view to be deleted from the Mol* session. To replace a view, click on the horizontal parallel arrows icon. This will replace the view with the current view in the 3D canvas. Deleting and replacing views are actions that cannot be undone. Opening Saved Views: There are two ways to open saved views in Mol*. All saved views will be listed in the Views menu. Click on a view to open it. If multiple views are saved, they can be accessed using a drop-down menu at the top of the 3D canvas. Clicking on a view will open it. The order in which the views are listed depends on the time they were saved. To reorder the views, use the up and down arrows next to each view in the Views menu. In default mode, use the arrows pointing left and right to switch between saved views. Cycle Through Saved Views: In default mode, click the \u201cplay\u201d button in the toolbar at the top of the 3D canvas to cycle between all saved views.

Superposition Panel (only available at molstar.org/viewer/ ) The Superposition Panel rotates and translates molecular structures to make them match other structures. Mol* performs superpositions by matching selected chains or atoms. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the superposed structures will be listed in the Log Panel at the bottom of the application window. To access the Superposition Panel, two or more structures must be uploaded at molstar.org/viewer . The Superposition Panel will appear in the Controls Panel next to the 3D canvas. Superposing by Chains: In order to superpose structures by chains, two or more selections from separate structures are required. Regions of a chain can also be selected for superposition. For each PDB entry, selections must be limited to single polymer chains per structure. If using a region of a chain, only one region per chain can be used for each structure. After making two or more selections, click \u201cSuperpose\u201d to superpose the structures in the 3D canvas. While the superposition is per chain, the resulting 3D transformation is always applied to the whole structure. When superposing more than two structures, note that the alignment is done to the first structure. The RMSD will be listed in the Log Panel. Superposing by Atoms: In order to superpose structures by atoms, one or more atoms from separate structures must be selected. Select one or more atoms and click \u201cSuperpose\u201d to superpose the structures in the 3D canvas. The superposition is done on all given pairs of atoms in the order they appear in the panel. To reorder the atoms, use the up and down arrows in the panel. The RMSD will be listed in the Log Panel.

This section is aimed at explaining the fundamentals of how Mol* works and how to effectively perform actions within it. Focus Focusing adjusts the view of the camera and the center of rotation on specific atoms, residues, or parts of structures. Once the camera is focused on a selection, other items in the structure may appear hidden from the camera because they fall outside the region being viewed or are clipped. There are four ways to change the focus of the camera: In default mode, click on a residue in the 3D canvas. It will automatically be centered and zoomed-in. The residue along with its surrounding residues will be represented as ball & stick. All local non-covalent interactions will be shown. In default mode, click on a residue in the Sequence Panel. It will automatically be centered and zoomed-in. The residue along with its surrounding residues will be represented as ball & stick and nearby interactions will be shown. If an object is listed in the Components Panel , it can be clicked on which will make it the focus of the camera. If an object is currently selected, it will be listed in the Structure Panel . For example, if four residues are selected, the Structure Panel will read \u201c4 Residues Selected.\u201d If this text is clicked on, the four residues will become the focus. Selections Logic Making selections is often the first step to performing a range of operations. Selections are made using Selection Mode which is activated using the cursor or arrow head icon in the Toggle Menu. The Picking Level determines the specificity of the selection. For example, keeping the Picking Level on \u201cresidue\u201d enables individual or groups of amino acid residues to be selected, while changing the Picking Level to \u201cchain\u201d allows whole chains to be selected. After the desired Picking Level is chosen, selections can be made by: Clicking on parts of the structure in the 3D canvas Clicking on residues in the Sequence Panel Using the Set Operations Menus in Selection Mode toolbar After selections are made, several tasks can be directly performed using the current selection. These include: Creating a component of the current selection Coloring the current selection Changing the transparency of the current selection Changing the representation of the current selection (e.g., ball & stick, molecular surface) Removing the current selection from the 3D canvas Focusing on the current selection Creating measurements Components Logic After making a selection, a component can be made from it. Creating components allows the user to make groupings of certain parts of a structure which can later be manipulated. It is not always necessary to create components, but it can be helpful in certain circumstances. For example, if you have selected a number of residues in a protein that you may be returning to multiple times to perform different actions, it may be helpful to create a component for quick reference. The following are actions that can be performed with components: Showing/hiding using the eye icon Changing the representation Coloring by various requirements Modifying the component by selection to add, subtract, or intersect pieces Deleting the component - this will remove the grouping but the structure will remain intact Once again, it is not always required to make components, but can be useful for easy reference. Clicking on a component in the Components Panel will quickly focus on that component in the 3D canvas. Additionally, the component can be easily selected from the Components Panel.

More sources: Developer documentation for Mol* MolViewSpec extension MolViewSpec home page Python library molviewspec for building MolViewSpec views Python library molviewspec in action MolViewSpec data structure MolViewSpec is based on a tree format, i.e. a molecular view is described as a tree where individual node types represent common data operations needed to create the view (e.g. download, parse, color). A MolViewSpec tree can be stored in .mvsj file format. Refer to the developer documentation for more details or see a few examples here . MolViewSpec extension in Mol* Viewer There are multiple ways to load MolViewSpec views ( .mvsj files) into Mol* Viewer: Drag&drop support: The easiest way to load a MVS view is to drag a .mvsj file and drop it in a browser window with Mol* Viewer. Test with this file: 1cbs.mvsj (make sure to save it with .mvsj extension, not .txt ) Load via menu: Another way to load a MVS view is to use \"Download File\" or \"Open Files\" action, available in the \"Home\" tab in the left panel. For these actions, the \"Format\" parameter must be set to \"MVSJ\" (in the \"Miscellaneous\" category) or \"Auto\". Test with this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molstar/molstar/master/examples/mvs/1cbs.mvsj URL parameters: Mol* Viewer supports mvs-url , mvs-data , and mvs-format URL parameters to specify a MVS view to be loaded when the viewer is initialized. mvs-url specifies the address from which the MVS view should be retrieved. mvs-data specifies the MVS view data directly. Keep in mind that some characters must be escaped to be used in the URL. Also beware that URLs longer than 2000 character may not work in all browsers. mvs-format specifies the format of the MVS view data (from mvs-url or mvs-data ). The only allowed (and default) value is mvsj , as this is currently the only supported format.

If you are not familiar with Mol* Viewer, it will take you a bit of time to get your brearings, so we hope that these examples will help you on your journey. Across experiments and scales San Martin et al. conducted extensive cryo-EM imaging and refined 3D reconstruction of a large bacteriophage by fitting a crystalographic model of P3, the major protein forming the capsid of this bacteriophage, into the cryo-EM data. They were then able to infer potential interactions between the capsid protein and an underlying membrane holding the genomic material of this bacteriophage, as well as to derive a model of this bacteriophage at quasi-atomic resolution. With Mol*VS, wou can now examine the outcomes of these complex experiments interactively in the web browser and conduct further examinations of your own. Access a pre-made visualization state of the bacteriophage . Examine source data: cryo-EM map available in EMDB as EMD-1014 ; crystallographic model used for refining the cryo-EM reconstructions available in PDB as 1HX6 ; 3D models of the bacteriophage at quasi-atomic resolution as derived from this study available in PDB as 1HB5 (P3-shell), 1HB7 (nonsense mutant that does not package DNA), and 1HB9 (wild type). Comparing segmentations Segmentation, which is the decomposition of a 2D or 3D image into regions that can be associated with defined objects, has been recognized as the bridge to interpreting microscopy data in a biological context. A plethora of volume segmentation algorithms and tools are available via commercial or non-commercial solutions, each with their own requirements for input/output formats and limitations related to data processing. There is no consensus regarding the best method to obtain segments that can be associated with a biologically relevant role. Most often, it is necesary to try several approaches and compare the outcomes. Dongsheng et al. reconstructed 3D density maps from cryo-TEM experiments of human plasma intermedia-density lipoproteins in complex with mouse antibodies. They were then able to infer that such lipoprotein particles have a polyhedral shape and are composed of low-density cores and high-density shells. Lipoporteins serve to transport fat in the bloodstream, and thus their shape and structure may represent key drivers of atherosclerosis risk. Therefore, a more detailed characterization of their shape is highly desirable and can be achieved by segmenting the density map into smaller connected shapes. However, it is unclear what segmentation tool will be most useful for this endeavor. With Mol*VS, you can easily compare the outcomes of different segmentation methods applied to the same data set and decide which is more useful for your particular situation. To illustrate, we have obtained segmentations of the cryo-TEM map in two ways. First, the map was loaded into IMOD and two segments were drawn manually as contours, which were then interpolated over all slices and exported as a mesh. Next, the same map was loaded in ChimeraX, the Segment Map tool (Segger plugin) was used to perform automatic segmentation with default settings and a default density threshold of 0.334671, and the output lattice was stored in the Mol*VS internal database.

As of December 2022, EMDB and EMPIAR together contain less than 20 entries with segmentation data , and even these few data sets are not fully consistent in terms of data hierarchy. This is expected to change in the future, as substantial effort is being expended to unify cell imaging data under EMDB-SFF (electron microscopy) and OME-NGFF (light microscopy). We are actively cooperating with teams from EMDB, EMPIAR, and BioImageArchive to ensure that Mol*VS always contains the latest segmentation data available in these primary sources. Meanwhile, we have included several examples to indicate that Mol*VS is prepared to handle data sets delivered in EMDB-SFF, other formats that can be converted to EMDB-SFF via the sfftk Python package integrated in Mol*VS (.am, .mod, .seg, .stl), and OME-NGFF. One important limitation is related to the data structures currently used by Mol*VS. Specifically, it is currently not possible to store and display multiple segmentations for the same volumetric map within the same entry. These will show as separate entries of the internal Mol*VS database (e.g., emd-90940001 and emd-90940002 were obtained from the same source data emd-9094 using different segmentation tools). However, such entries can be displayed concomitantly and thus easily compared. Finally, some limitations are related to the current state of Mol* Viewer. Because the source data vary substantially, it has so far not been possible to establish default settings that work equally well for all data sets and all machines. We describe these below in the hope that you will be able to overcome whatever trouble you encounter while using Mol*VS. GPU support Some graphics cards may fail to render certain data, or may render them wrong. If the Mol* Viewer Log Panel (bottom) does not report any error but you cannot see anything in the 3D Canvas (center), go to the Control Panel (left), open the Global options and try turning GPU support off. Alternatively, you may try to run Mol* Viewer with WebGL 1 . Isosurface Some data sets may fail to render or may render wrong or with too much noise when using the default isosurface settings. If the Mol* Viewer Log Panel (bottom) does not report any error but you cannot see anything or what you see seems wrong or noisy in the 3D Canvas (center), go to the Control Panel (left), open the Detailed Volume Params , click the three dots to open the Isosurface options, and try tuning the Iso Value . Direct volume Some data sets may fail to render or may render wrong or with too much noise when using isosurface render. If the Mol* Viewer Log Panel (bottom) does not report any error but you are not satisfied with the representation in the 3D Canvas (center), go to the Control Panel (left) and change the Volume Type from Isosurface to Direct volume .

The integration and visualization of correlative and multimodal data is among the most significant challenges in modern biological imaging, and vital to furthering our understanding of biological systems across scales. To address this challenge, we developed Mol* Volumes and Segmentations (Mol*VS), which extends the scope of Mol* Viewer to the cellular scale. What Mol*VS is an open-source extension of Mol* Viewer dedicated to real-time visualization of large-scale volumetric data from cryo-EM, light microscopy, volume-EM, and other imaging experiments, as well as their segmentations and biological annotations. Mol*VS pre-processes volumetric and segmentation data and delivers it to a dedicated Mol* Viewer extension so that even very large datasets can be visualized in real time and alongside macromolecular structure data with residue and atomic-level information. Mol*VS has been running since September 2022 and provides seamless access to all curated segmentation datasets available in EMDB and EMPIAR . As availability of segmentation data remains scarce, we also provide a few entries derived from EMDB, BioImage Archive, and Image Data Resource datasets. Individual users and platforms providing access to cell imaging data can freely host a local instance of Mol*VS. How Mol*VS has four major components, namely a preprocessing module, an internal database with preprocessed data, a server module that queries the internal database, and a client module that requests and interprets the data received so that it can be displayed. Mol*VS takes input in EMDB-SFF and segmentation formats (.am, .mod, .seg, .stl) converted to EMDB-SFF using the EMDB-SFF Toolkit integrated in Mol*VS. We also handle 3D map volumes from EM reconstruction and added experimental support for OME-NGFF , focused on light microscopy. These formats were devised by international consortia following ongoing consultations with the scientific community, aiming to support the unification of storage and delivery of bioimaging data and metadata in an accessible, traceable, and scalable fashion. First, Mol*VS processes the volumetric and segmentation data into an internal format ( Zarr ). These pre-processed data are stored in the internal database in both original and downsampled forms, together with pre-computed statistics, metadata, and internal annotations for each data set. This step happens only when entries in the internal database need to be added/removed/changed. Whenever data are requested by the client module, the server module performs a relevant query of the internal database and then packs and delivers the requested data to the client module, which then unpacks the data and feeds them to Mol* Viewer. The pre-processing and data delivery approaches used by Mol*VS are key to the ability to enable fast and interactive visualization in the web browser irrespective of the size of the original data set. Due to its perfect integration within the Mol* ecosystem, Mol*VS effectively enables web-based concomitant and interactive visualization of 3D volumes of cells, organelles, and molecules together with volume segmentations and their annotations.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"volumes_and_segmentations/overview/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"volumes_and_segmentations/overview/#why","text":"Volume segmentation data are increasingly more available in public databases such as EMDB, EMPIAR, BioImage Archive, and the Image Data Resource, thus increasing the need for interactive web-based visualization of these data and their interpretation in a wider biological context.

We have prepared a tutorial to help you navigate the technical steps required for you to host Mol*VS locally. This is a pretty technical tutorial, so first check if you really need to do this. Use case #1: You are a biologist and have volume or mesh segmentation data that you wish to visualize before/without submission to a public database. Perhaps you are working with sensitive or embargoed data that should not be shared. Or perhaps you just want to examine the data visually or double-check the format compatibility before you start the cumbersome process of submission to a public database. Use case #2: You are an organization and have volume or mesh segmentation data that you wish to share with a private or public user base such that the users can visualize the data in the web browser without having to download anything. Perhaps your team is working from different locations across the world, and they need an easy way to collaborate. Or perhaps you are building a public or proprietary database of microscopy data. If your situation corresponds to one of these use cases, and if dealing with scripts sounds enticing to you, proceed to the tutorial and find out how to host your own independent instance of Mol*VS.
